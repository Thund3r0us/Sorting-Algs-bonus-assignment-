Bonus Assignment (Sorting Algs)
Nicole Walsh COP3502 CS1 in C

implemented parseData function
implemented selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort and heap sort algorithms in the corresponding functions respectively. 

Added heapify function to make heapsort much easier to code

Bubble, insertion and selection sort algorithms work in O(n^2) runtime; mergeSort and heapSort work in O(nlogn)
